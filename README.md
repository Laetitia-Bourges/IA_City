# IA_City

This project was an exercice that I had to produced during my training in gameplay programming.

I have implements a general behaviour for fictitious PNG IA.
Each IA have their own schedule for the day. They have differents random buildings to visit and they go back home at the end of their day.
They used a navmesh for their deplacement.

They are also a night/day cycle with streetlights that turn on and off depending on the time of day.
